With an insatiable curiosity and a drive for success, I have not only gotten outstanding grades but also actively participated in academic competitions and earned recognition, such as being a champion in the MTAP competition. I'm also active in extra-curricular activities, and one of the awards I garnered was being GSP of the Year. Through this, I want to inspire my fellow students and be a shining example of what can be achieved through dedication and a love for learning.</div>

I still remember the feeling of competing for the first time. It was a great experience that became a driving force for me to join the world of pageantry. I won the title of Miss TCSNHS 2019, Miss Chapel 2022, and my recently, Miss SK Tabugon 2023. As I embark on this incredible journey towards the pageant stage, I am filled with excitement and gratitude. I am eager to use this platform to amplify my voice, inspire others, and make a positive impact. </div>

    <div class="desc">From a young age, I discovered the magic of dance. It ignited a fire within me, awakening my love for movement and rhythm. In my first year, I joined the folk dance audition in our institute and was gladly selected. Through it, I was able to be a part of the folk dance team that represents our university at the STRASUC Festival held at Batangas State University in 2022. Additionally, I also became a part again of the folk dance team that represents the university at Occidental Mindoro State College in 2023. In those two competitions, we got the 3rd place. The experiences, friendships, and knowledge gained during practice have shaped me into the person I am today.</div>

    <div class="desc">This award is an award for myself as life is a rollercoaster, and I have faced my fair share of challenges along the way. Anxiety and sadness have been constant companions throughout my life. The weight of academic pressures, expectations, and the fear of failure often felt overwhelming. These emotions created a cloud of self-doubt and hindered my ability to fully embrace life's opportunities. However, I refused to let these shadows define me. It hasn't been an easy road, but I am proud of the progress I have made. Remember, you are not alone, and with determination, support, and self-compassion, you can rise above the shadows and achieve your goals.</div>
